    <p>I put this resource together after realizing that the average reef
        aquarium hobbyist is generally unaware of the potential for exposure
        to palytoxin from their reef tanks.</p>

    <h2>Google Ads</h2>
    <p>For full disclosure, this website is a low traffic website running on top
        of Google AppEngine and my goal is to be able to make enough with 
        Google Ads in order to offset the cost of running it.</p>
